The question we needed to address was basically : are people really using our product?  The reason is that we the product team can use it to figure how to really help, add value, and benefit the people using our product. We calculated the adoption rate using the following formula : Adoption rate = number of 30-day active users / total number of users in scope. Luckily in most countries people actually used the app. For those reporting bad figures in terms of adoption, before planning any session we tried to understand if there were any external issue preventing people to use the app (change in mobile phone assets, company IT policies...). The metrics we setup for this project were the following : ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Time on task")," (more complicated to measure than it seems!), ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Succes rate"),", ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Error rate"),", ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Degree of enjoyment"),", ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Time to 1st task")," and ",s.a.createElement("strong",null,"Abandonment rate"),". Before contacting the countries we also made sure their defect backlog would be empty without any issue unaddressed. Once we were confident with the data we planned 1 day to catch-up with local team to run our metrics testing and make sure nothing has been left behind. This feedback session was the official closure of the project in terms of meetings and tasks.

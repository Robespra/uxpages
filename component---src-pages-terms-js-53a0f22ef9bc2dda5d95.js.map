We deliver UI review (from a front-end and usability perspective and from a conversion rate perspective) and analytics reports. Consulting activities deliverables include the following : PET Checklist, Front-end Checklist, Affordance Analysis, Quick Wins to Reach Your KPIs, User Testing Guides, Conversion Checklist, Form Analysis, Responsive Report, Funnel Definition, Optimization Plan, Heuristic Evaluation, SWOT Analysis, UI Benchmark, a/b Test Setup, Field Study &amp; User Interview, Behaviour Analysis, Cognitive Ergonomics, UX Value Proposition, Product Strategy &amp; Concept Testing, Fully Coded Prototype, Inputs from Industry Experts, Predictive Analysis. Logistics costs for user interview or testing sessions (including uxpages consultants travel expenses) will be charged to the customer</p>\n            <p> 2.1 HTML, CSS and Javascript. We deliver templates (Fully Coded Prototype or final optimized design) developed from HTML5 markup, CSS3 stylesheets for styling and Javascript for poly-fills and behaviours.</p>\n            <p>2.3 a/b testing. We deliver a/b testing in PHP or RoR languages. Quick wins testing might be implemented using Google optimize tools. Please refer to our privacy policy for data details.</p>\n            <p>2.4 Browser testing. Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of\n            different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean that uxpages will ensure that a user’s\n            experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.</p>\n            <p>2.5 Desktop browser testing. uxpages test the work to be delivered in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We’ll also\n            test to ensure Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 for Windows users get an appropriate, possibly\n            different, experience. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>2.6 Mobile browser testing. Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our work in:\n            iOS up to v6: Safari, Google Chrome and Opera Mini\n            Android 5, 6, 7, 8 : Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera Mini. We currently don’t test Blackberry OS or Blackberry QNX, Opera Mobile, Symbian or other Android\n            mobile browsers under v4. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>2.7 Technical support. uxpages is not a website hosting company but we will use OVH servers if we agree to implement integrated a/b testing on our servers. This setup will include Google Analytics and Google Optimize. Once the testing phase finalizes, the content will be removed and removal evidences will be provided to the customer. uxpages will offer Technical Support for this Service via OVH support desk. For any issue relating to the Service, Customer may contact uxpages’s technical support by sending an email to hola@uxpages.com. Only Customer or Customer’s authorized user may contact uxpages’s technical support. If the a/b testing or any improvement is hosted by client, uxpages will not provide any technical support related to hosting.</p>\n            <h3>3. Out-of-scope and Change Orders</h3>\n            <p>3.1 We know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit\n            you to your earliest ideas. We don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at\n            the beginning is based on the length of time we estimate we’ll need to accomplish\n            everything you’ve told us you want to achieve, but we’re happy to be flexible. If you want to\n            change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as we’ll provide a separate\n            estimate for that.</p>\n            <p>3.2 The prices at the beginning of this document are based on the number of days that we estimate\n            we'll need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve. If you do want to\n            change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality, that won't be a\n            problem. You will be charged according to the time it takes us to accommodate these changes. We\n            will always make sure you are aware of these costs in writing before charging you. Along the way\n            we might ask you to put requests in writing so we can keep track of changes. The Company, without invalidating this Agreement, may order changes in\n            the work within the general scope of the Agreement consisting of additions, deletions, or other\n            revisions.</p>\n            <p>3.3 Adjustments to Compensation. In the event that any such changes materially impact the\n            cost to the Contractor of performing the Services or the time required for such performance, the\n            parties shall negotiate in good faith a reasonable and equitable adjustment in the applicable Fees and\n            schedule, as applicable.</p>\n            <h3>4.

Customer hereby understands and accepts that any risk or damages arising out of the use or performance of the  Beta Product or Service will be Customer’s responsibility.</p>\n            <p>4.4 It is hereby clarified that the Beta Product or Service may contain bugs, errors, omissions, and other problems, and uxpages will not provide any support and maintenance for its beta  Products or Services. The Beta Product or Service may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to first commercial availability, or may be withdrawn at any time.

Once the  Beta Product or Service is terminated, uxpages will not be obliged to provide continued access to data collected during the testing period after the beta is terminated. However, uxpages shall delete the data collected during the Beta phase upon receipt of a written request for deletion of such data by Customer.</p>\n            <h3>5.

In case it is found that Customer’s use of Services violates the terms of this Agreement or any other law, rule or regulation enacted by the concerned authorities from time to time, uxpages reserves the right to terminate the Agreement/Contract with immediate effect.</p>\n            <p>5.2 uxpages's Responsibilities, Representations and Warranties in the performance of Services, uxpages agrees to: perform the Services to the best of its ability and with the degree of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances;\n            liaise with Customer through Customer’s coordinator on matters related to the use of, and the identification and resolution of errors in the Service; however, this shall not include the provision of training services;\n            invoice Customer according to the terms of this Agreement for the Services performed; and\n            proceed according to Customer’s reasonable instructions for the disposition of Customer’s data and supplies on the termination of the Agreement.</p>\n            <p>5.3 Customer's Responsibilities, Representations and Warranties : Client acknowledges that he shall be responsible for performing the following in a reasonable and timely manner : </p>\n            <p>5.3 a.
